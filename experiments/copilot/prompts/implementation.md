You are implementing multi-threaded parsing for SCIONA code_analysis layer. Current single thread execution must stay and remain the default. Introduce an optional multi-threaded parsing mode behind an option switch.

The solution must respect the architectural principles described in docs/DEVELOPERGUIDE.md, including SCI immutability, deterministic reducer outputs, stable structural identifiers, and ordering guarantees.

Requirements: parsing results (SCI / reducers) must remain deterministic; no changes in DS schemas; no changes to reducer contracts; no snapshot hash instability; no race conditions in CoreDB / ArtifactDB writes.

Implement all necessary code-level modifications. Implement the described functionality without altering existing architectural layering beyond what is necessary for multi-threaded parsing support. Do not run tests.
